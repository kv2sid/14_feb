    "1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "Answer - Multithreading is a programming technique in python in which threads of execution are created within a single programe, allowing multiple task to performed concurrently. Each programs runs independently of others, but they can share the same memory and resource of the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the commonly used classes and function in threading module include:\n",
    "1. Thread: This is the main class in the threading module and is used to create thread. It has a 'run' method that decide what thread will do. \n",
    "2. Lock: This is a class that will provide a way to lock out a thread so that other threads cannot access a shared resource at the same time.\n",
    "3. Rlock: It is same a lock class. but it will required at multiple times by the same thread.\n",
    "4. Semaphor: This is a class that allows a fixed number of thread to access the resource.\n",
    "5. Event: This is a class that provides a way of thread to wait for the certain condition to be true.\n",
    "6. Condition: This is a class that provides a way of thread to wait for the certain conditon to be true until the thread will lock.\n",
    "7. ThreadLocal : This is a class that provide a way to create thread-local variable which are variable specific to each thread."

Deadlock can occur when multiple threads try to acquire a lock on a shared resource in a different order, or when a thread acquires multiple locks but doesn't release them in the correct order.\n",
